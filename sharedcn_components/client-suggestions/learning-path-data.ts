   Learning Paths — the sequenced counterpart to Assign

   The distinction the whole feature rests on:

     ONE item          → Assign. Individual or group. Send.
     MANY items, and
     the ORDER matters → Learning Path. Curate, sequence, send.

   A path step carries a *role* — Understand / Apply / Explore /
   Discuss — which is how the advisor tells the client what this
   step is for. Roles are the advisor's editorial voice; Finny
   may propose them but never commits them.

   Finny's insight is per client and derived from the context the
   advisor already has: discovery notes, queries the client
   raised, goal trajectory, previous learning, engagement. It
   produces objectives and a suggested sequence. Applying either
   one only rearranges the canvas — nothing is sent, nothing is
   approved, nothing reaches the client.
